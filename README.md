=====================

## About this project

Beacon is a mobile app that provides local resources for victims of natural disasters. It has a list of resources shown by geolocation and 50 mile radius. It also allows a user to set a Beacon. Doing this will contact the resources for you via various means. Some will use email, some will use Slack, some will use API calls.
